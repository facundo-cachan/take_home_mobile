# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facundo-cachan/take_home_mobile
```

## Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn
```
### Update dependencies

```bash
# using package.json scripts
# using npm
npm run update:android
npm run update:ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn update:android
yarn update:ios
```

## Step 3: Run the app

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 4: Enjoy App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's test it.

### Now what?
